A finance automation tool for small to medium sized businesses to manage their financial health and easily view the summaries.
Worked as the sole frontend web engineer for a year. Came up with the MVP for the company to present to investors. Key features included:
- Invoicing & reconciliation. Create multiple or single invoices or sync them from another ERP like Zoho. 
- Counterparties. Register customers and vendors and their banking details.
- Payment accounts. Help businesses collect money and view transactions.
- Payment gateway. Allow customers of the business to pay using MPESA, Card or Bank.
- Sync accounts. Businesses are allowed to sync other ERPs and Banks.
