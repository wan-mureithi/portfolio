A web app for people to hire out the cars they are investing in. The system creates a platform for car owners, drivers and riders to interact.
I worked as the sole frontend developer.

- Worked with the project owner and UI designer to come up with a wonderful user experience for the project.
- Managed the project process using Asana tool to keep track of the work and timelines set. 
- Communicated with the project owner on the progress of the system on a weekly basis. Did demos of the work done from designs to integrations.
- Developed the UI using React JS and Material UI.
- Integrated the APIs using Axios and React Query.
- Handled third party integrations like Google Maps API, Mpesa API and Flutterwave payment API.
